# Smart Recipe Assistant 🍽️
A prototype machine learning project that analyzes food images and recommends ingredient adjustments for healthier outcomes.

## Overview
The Smart Recipe Assistant uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify food images and provide basic suggestions for salt and spice levels.  
It combines image processing with simple nutritional analysis to help users make smarter cooking decisions.

## Features
- Image classification of food items using CNN
- Ingredient and salt-level recommendations
- Basic data visualization dashboard for recipe stats
- Lightweight prototype built for experimentation

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  

## How It Works
1. Upload or select a food image.  
2. Model predicts food category and suggests healthier adjustments.  
3. Dashboard displays the recommendation summary.

## Future Enhancements
- Add user preference learning and meal-tracking.  
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
